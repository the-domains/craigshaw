    description: "Organizations are often run according to \"the superchicken model,\" where the value is placed on star employees who outperform others. And yet, this isn't what drives the most high-achieving teams. Business leader Margaret Heffernan observes that it is social cohesion - built every coffee break, every time one team member asks another for help - that leads over time to great results."

    description: "Body language affects how others see us, but it may also change how we see ourselves. Social psychologist Amy Cuddy shows how \"power posing\" -- standing in a posture of confidence, even when we don't feel confident -- can affect testosterone and cortisol levels in the brain, and might even have an impact on our chances for success."

description: 'Advertising adds value to a product by changing our perception, rather than the product itself. Rory Sutherland makes the daring assertion that a change in perceived value can be just as satisfying as what we consider "real" value -- and his conclusion has interesting consequences for how we look at life.'
